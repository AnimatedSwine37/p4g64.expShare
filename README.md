## Features
Makes inactive party members and Personas gain exp and level up!

By default both inactive party members and the protagonist's Personas will get the same exp as active ones, this can be changed in the mod's configuration. If you only want Persona exp share or party member exp share just set the multiplier of the other to 0.

This mod can also optionally give exp to party members that were knocked out at the end of a battle (in vanilla they wouldn't get any). This is disabled by default and be can be turned on in the configuration.
